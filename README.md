# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
A Comparative Analysis of Linear and Machine Learning Models for Used Car Price Prediction

## Purpose
This study explores predictive models for estimating used car prices, addressing challenges in price prediction by analyzing both linear and machine learning approaches. It aims to understand the complex relationships between automotive characteristics and market values, filling a critical gap in automotive market analytics.

## Design/Methodology/Approach
The study compares four predictive models: Ordi- nary Least Squares (OLS) regression, ElasticNet regularization, Random Forest, and XGBoost. A dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing 188,000 samples with information on car prices and features such as mileage, model year, and accident history, was analyzed. Model performance was evaluated using metrics including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2).

## Findings
Machine learning models, particularly Random Forest (RMSE 59,275.15) and XGBoost (RMSE 60,006.78), outperformed linear models (OLS and ElasticNet) in capturing non-linear relationships, demonstrating superior accuracy and practical utility. Ensemble methods proved most effective in addressing complex interactions between vehicle features. Key predictors included mileage, model year, and engine specifications, reflecting their strong influence on pricing.

## Originality/Value
This research provides a novel comparative framework for used car price prediction, highlighting the advantages of machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and XGBoost. The findings offer practical insights for model selection and feature im- portance, contributing to better decision-making in the automotive industry. Future research may incorporate external market trends to further enhance predictive accuracy.
